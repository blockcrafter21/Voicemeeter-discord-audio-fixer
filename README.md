# Important  
The EXE will request Admin privileges on Start, this is cuz python need access to the Audiodg process.  
If you run the .py make sure that the Python interpreter has Admin permissions
# What does this program?  
If you use the popular Audio mixing software [Voicemeeter](https://voicemeeter.com), you may encounter issues with Discord.  
In this case, modifications to the audiodg.exe process will help, the problem is that you need to apply these changes after every start of your computer.  
There are programs like ProcessLasso, but ProcessLasso asks you to buy a License after some time.  
This program will start at startup, only asking you to give it Admin permissions and you're done.  
Please note that making some changes to the exe is mandatory, but a Tutorial to this will come.  
The EXE is found [here](https://github.com/blockcrafter21/Voicemeeter-discord-audio-fixer/releases/download/v1.0.0/Voicemeeter_Discord_Fixer.exe), but you can run the python program, if you do not want to run an unknown executable.
